# Community

For chat-style communication we have [Drone OS Discord
channel](https://discord.gg/W4swRf9) and [drone-os Matrix
room](https://matrix.to/#/#drone-os:matrix.org). And there is a bridge between
these two.

Our [drone-os GitHub organization](https://github.com/drone-os) consists of
multiple repositories. Two must general of them are
[drone](https://github.com/drone-os/drone) and
[drone-core](https://github.com/drone-os/drone-core).
