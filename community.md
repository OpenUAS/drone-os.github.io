For chat-style communication we have [drone-os **Matrix**
room](https://matrix.to/#/#drone-os:matrix.org).

Our [drone-os **GitHub** organization](https://github.com/drone-os) consists of
multiple repositories. Two most general of them are
[drone](https://github.com/drone-os/drone) and
[drone-core](https://github.com/drone-os/drone-core).
